  <div class="space-y-6">

    <div>
      <p class="font-bold text-green-700 italic mb-1">🌿 Casual and comfortable</p>
      <p class="text-base">The setting is warm and welcoming. It might take place in a cozy room, a community space, or even online—without pressure to "perform" or speak if you don't feel like it.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="font-bold text-yellow-700 italic mb-1">🤝 Shared experiences</p>
      <p class="text-base">You meet other women who are also navigating motherhood, career stress, emotional overload, or similar challenges. Just knowing you're not alone is incredibly healing.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="font-bold text-purple-700 italic mb-1">💬 Open conversations</p>
      <p class="text-base">People talk about real struggles—juggling roles, guilt, exhaustion, self-doubt—and others listen, nod, or share their own journey. It builds a sense of <em>togetherness</em>, not judgment.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="font-bold text-yellow-700 italic mb-1">🎗️ Facilitated by a counsellor</p>
      <p class="text-base">There’s usually a trained counsellor guiding the flow—asking gentle questions, keeping the space safe, and helping people explore their thoughts with care and respect.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="font-bold text-pink-700 italic mb-1">🌸 Healing through connection</p>
      <p class="text-base">Hearing someone else say “I’ve felt that too” can be deeply reassuring. It reminds you that your feelings are valid—and that there’s strength in vulnerability.</p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <p class="font-bold my-5">Group talk is not about giving advice—it’s about being there for one another.</p>

  <p class="text-base">It’s perfect for women who are craving connection, emotional release, or simply a space to just <em>be themselves</em>, without masks.</p>
