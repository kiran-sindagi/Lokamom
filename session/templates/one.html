      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-[#0f766e]">Here’s what to expect in a one-on-one session:</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-4 pl-6 mb-8">
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-[#0f766e]">You talk, they listen.</span> The counselor won’t judge you or tell you what to do. They’ll help you understand your feelings, offer clarity, and guide you toward solutions that work for <em>you</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-[#0f766e]">Completely private.</span> Whatever you say stays between you and your counselor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-[#0f766e]">Paced at your comfort.</span> You don’t have to explain everything all at once. You share what you’re ready to, at your own pace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-[#0f766e]">Supportive and empowering.</span> The goal isn’t to “fix” you—it’s to help you feel stronger, clearer, and more grounded.
        </li>
      </ul>    
      <p class="mb-4">Many women find one-on-one counseling helpful when they:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-4 pl-6 mb-8">
        <li>Feel overwhelmed by work, parenting, or family roles</li>
        <li>Struggle with decision-making, guilt, or burnout</li>
        <li>Want to talk without being interrupted, judged, or given “advice”</li>
        <li>Are looking for ways to cope, heal, and feel more balanced</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">It’s okay to ask for help. One-on-one counseling is simply one way of saying, <em>I matter too.</em></p>
      <p>If you want, I can explain how to begin, what the first session feels like, or how to find the right counsellor.</p>
