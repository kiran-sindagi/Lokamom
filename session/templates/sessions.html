                A one-on-one counseling session is a private, personal conversation between you and a
                trained mental health professional (counselor or therapist). It’s a safe, confidential space
                where you can talk about what’s on your mind—whether it’s stress, confusion, overwhelm,
                sadness, anxiety, or anything else you're carrying.

                Group counseling sessions are relaxed, supportive gatherings where a small group of
                people—often with similar life experiences—come together to talk, share, and support one
                another, usually with the gentle guidance of a trained counselor or facilitator.
                They’re not like classroom lectures or therapy “meetings”—they feel more like a heartfelt
                conversation in a safe circle, where everyone is heard, seen, and accepted.

                A stress management or life skills session for women is a supportive, practical, and often
                empowering gathering—either one-on-one or in a group—designed to help women cope with
                daily stress, build emotional strength, and learn essential life tools to manage
                responsibilities and relationships more confidently.
                These sessions are especially helpful for women dealing with overwhelm, financial
                hardship, parenting pressures, emotional burnout, or life transitions (like divorce, loss,
                or re-entering the workforce).
